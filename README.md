# Powershell-MappedDrives


This is designed to go into group policy and deployed as a logon script to allow you to gather all the mapped drive details when the user logs on.

You can also use a wmi- query which I will upload that consists of two lines that works with AutoTask AEM however it is device agnositc.



Don't think this can be improved upon other than removing duplicates if running over multiple sites. 


Any feedback is appreciated.
